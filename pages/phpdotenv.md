## PHP Dotenv

[PHP Dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) loads environment variables from a .env file into your application.

```
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv
```
Add your application configuration to a .env file in the root of your project. Make sure the .env file is added to your .gitignore so it is not checked-in with your code.
